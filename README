Code used for mlaC saturation mutagenesis.

1. Staturation.py 
  Saturation Mutagenesis primer generator. 
  This is a script that will take a gene input and out put pairs of primers for creating a NNS saturated mutagenetic library of the gene.

2. uniq.py & logfitness_n.py
  Scripts for processing data.
  They take an input fasta file (from saturation mutageneis experiments) and out put the log10 relative fitness scores of each mutation at every amino acid position. 
  These python scripts can be run in shell script:
  
 #!/usr/bin/env bash
  #$ -cwd
  #$ -S /bin/bash

  sample_1=$1 #path to merged fastq file from selective condition
  sample_2=$2 #path to merged fastq file from non-selective condition
  p3=$3 #label to indicate which "sub-library" fastq files are from

  python3.8 uniq.py -s ${sample_1} -l ${p3} &
  python3.8 uniq.py -s ${sample_2} -l ${p3}

  wait

  python3.8 logfitness_n.py -s1 ${sample_1} -s2 ${sample_2} -l ${p3}
