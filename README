Code used for mlaC saturation mutagenesis.

1. Staturation.py 
  Saturation Mutagenesis primer generator. 
  This is a script that will take a gene input and out put pairs of primers for creating a NNS saturated mutagenetic library of the gene.

2. uniq.py & logfitness_n.py
  Scripts for processing data.
  They take an input fasta file (from saturation mutageneis experiments) and out put the log10 relative fitness scores of each mutation at every amino acid position.
